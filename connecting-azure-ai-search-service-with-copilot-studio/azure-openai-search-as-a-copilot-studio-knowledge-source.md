# Using Azure AI Search as a Copilot Studio Generative Answers Knowledge Source

Azure AI Search is a powerful search engine that can be used to search for information in a large collection of documents. It can use any of the Azure OpenAI Models and can be used to search for information in a wide range of domains. In this article, we will show you how to use Azure AI Search as a Copilot Studio Knowledge Source for Generative Answers.

More information about this topic is found in the [Copilot Studio Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/nlu-generative-answers-azure-openai)

## Pre-requisites

To use Azure AI Search as a Copilot Studio Generative Answers Knowledge Source, you will need to have an Azure account. If you don't have an Azure account, you can create one for free at [https://azure.microsoft.com/](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

## Create an Azure Open AI Service

Detailed instructions are [here](./create-azure-openai-service.md)

> **NOTE** You will need the Azure OpenAI Resource name and API key to connect Copilot Studio to Azure Open AI. You can find this information in the Azure portal under your Azure Open AI service.

## Create an Azure Open AI Deployment

Detailed instructions are [here](./create-azure-openai-deployments.md)

Deploy both a completion model (for example, `gpt-35-turbo-16k`) and an embedding model (for example, `text-embedding-ada-002`).

> **NOTE** You will need the deployment names to connect Copilot Studio to Azure Open AI. You can find this information in the Azure OpenAI Studio portal or the Azure AI Studio portal portal under Deployments.

## Create an Azure AI Search Service

Detailed instructions are [here](./create-azure-ai-search-service.md)

> **NOTE** You will need the endpoint URL and API key to connect Copilot Studio to Azure Open AI Search. You can find this information in the Azure portal under your Azure Open AI Search service.
