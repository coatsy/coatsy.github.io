<div id='content'>Many of you have seen me <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2007/02/27/ecma-office-open-xml-session-at-ozfox.aspx">present</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2007/02/28/enabling-the-word-2007-developer-tab.aspx">on the new</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2007/03/01/linking-word-2007-content-controls-to-custom-xml.aspx">Office Open XML formats</a> and have heard me talking about how important it is that they're both open and a standard (even <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dglover/archive/2007/03/02/office-2007-isv-innovation-demo-code-and-links.aspx">Dave's been getting into the act</a>). They're currently an ECMA standard and have been submitted to ISO for consideration as an ISO standard as well. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmahugh/">Doug Mahugh</a> has just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmahugh/archive/2007/04/03/dis-ballot-period-for-ecma-376-dis-29500.aspx">posted</a> about that process moving to its next stage. Read Doug's post for all the details, but I've cross-posted the important bit here.

<blockquote> <b>Let your voice be heard</b></p> <p>If you're a developer working with Open XML and you'd like to see it become an ISO standard, there's something you can do to make a positive difference: contact your country's ISO representatives and let them know how Open XML is proividing unique benefits to your organization and your customers. The standards process is driven by local participation in each country, so make sure your country's representatives know what's at stake.  

<p>You can find email addresses and other local contact info for your country on <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/aboutiso/isomembers/MemberList.MemberSummary?MEMBERCODE=10">ISO's list of member bodies</a>. Let them know in your own words how standardization of Open XML will benefit your local software economy or provide unique benefits to local citizens. if you think things like custom XML schema support, content controls, SmartArt, documentation of formulas and digital signatures, and other unique areas of Open XML functionality are important, now is the time to speak up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like Doug says, now is the time to speak up.
