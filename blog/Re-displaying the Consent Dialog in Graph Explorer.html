<div id='content'><p>I was trying to follow along with <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/richard_dizeregas_blog/" target="_blank">Richard diZerega</a>â€™s excellent tutorial on using the Excel REST Api in the Microsoft Graph (<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Office-Dev-Show/Office-Dev-Show-Episode-28-Microsoft-Graph-and-Excel-APIs" target="_blank">Episode 28</a> of the <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Office-Dev-Show" target="_blank">Office Dev Show</a>). As he demonstrated, I was using the Graph Explorer and was able to find my workbook by GETting</p><pre>https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/root/children?$select=name,id</pre>
<p>And then get a reference to the workbook I wanted to use by GETting</p><pre>https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/[the id I found]/workbook</pre>
<p>I could even find out what was in cells A1:C1 on Sheet1 of the workbook by GETting</p><pre>https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/[the id I found]/workbook/worksheets('Sheet1')/range(address='Sheet1!A1:C1')</pre>
<p>BUT, when I tried to set the values in that range by PATCHing</p><pre>https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/[the id I found]/workbook/worksheets('Sheet1')/range(address='Sheet1!A1:C1')</pre>
<p>and passing</p><pre>{ "values" : [["First Name","Last Name","Company"]] }</pre>
<p>in the body, I got the following cryptic error:</p><pre>{
    "error": {
        "code": "EditModeAccessDenied",
        "message": "",
        "innerError": {
            "request-id": "6610f3fe-93d5-42b1-8687-0f53dce1e25c",
            "date": "2016-05-24T05:36:04"
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Which is pretty wierd, because I can quite happily edit the workbook in Excel online and even via other apps using the Graph.</p>
<p>It turns out that the problem was that I'd consented to the Graph Explorer application back in the days when it was a GET only interface, so I needed to pop up the common consent dialog again with the new permissions it needed for doing POST and PATCH (and DELETE)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be an easy way to do this (at least I couldn't find one). Then my mate Chad Brooks suggested that I needed to add the</p><pre>promt=consent</pre>
<p>parameter to the auth dialog page.</p>
<p>I re-launched the Graph Explorer and clicked the Sign In link. At the next page (the login page), I manually edited the URL to add the parameter and re-loaded. I logged in as normal and lo! I was presented with the common consent dialog. Now when I PATCH that range I get a much more sensible answer:</p><pre>{
