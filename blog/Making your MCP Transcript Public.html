<div id='content'>One of my colleagues pinged me yesterday asking how someone could prove to their employer that they were an MCP (or, conversely, how the employer could check such a claim). I pointed him to the MCP Transcript Sharing Tool. The MCP can provide the employer with a MCP Transcript Sharing Code, for example, mine is available from:

<a href="https://mcp.microsoft.com/authenticate/validatemcp.aspx">https://mcp.microsoft.com/authenticate/validatemcp.aspx</a> 

Transcript ID <code>735419</code> and access code <code>AndrewCoates</code>.

To enable this, the MCP needs to logon to the MCP members site and associate their MCP ID with their Live ID (nee Passport)
