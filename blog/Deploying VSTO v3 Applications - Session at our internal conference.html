<div id='content'>I just got confirmation that the session I proposed for our internal technical conference, TechReady has been accepted. <blockquote>   <h2>Deploying VSTO v3 Applications</h2>    <p>Building compelling, contextual applications on the Microsoft Office platform has become much simpler with the release of VSTO v3 with VS2008. Often, though, one of the key impediments to adoption of this technology is the difficulty in deploying and maintaining the applications. This session explores the options for deploying VSTO applications and provides a step-by-step checklist for deploying both inside and outside the firewall. Finally it will cover troubleshooting deployment issues.</p> </blockquote><p>I'll be spending some time working on this topic over the next 3 or 4 weeks. If you've got questions or observations on this topic, please <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/contact.aspx" target="_blank">drop me a note</a> and I'll do some research and incorporate my findings in the session if appropriate. It looks like I'll also be giving this session in the Developer track at <a href="http://clk.atdmt.com/AUM/go/mcrssmst0380000036aum/direct/01/" target="_blank">TechEd Australia</a>.</p></div>
