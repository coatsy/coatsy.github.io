<div id='content'>I was presenting on Service Oriented Architecture today to a group of developers from a large Australian wealth management company. There were a number of really cool things about this talk.

Firstly, the group I presented to was an internal user group (or as Dave would have it, an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/davidlem/archive/2006/07/25/677643.aspx">Eye Tee Cee</a>). They meet monthly at lunch time and have technical sessions just like any community user group would. 

Next, I used Team Foundation Server as the back-end for all of the code I showed. This wouldn't be so cool on its own, but this was the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dglover/archive/2006/08/07/690479.aspx">world's smallest TFS</a>, sitting under Dave Glover's staircase in Melbourne. I was connecting to it over an iBurst wireless card, through the cloud and all with pretty acceptable performance.

Finally, taking a leaf out of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charles_sterling">Chuck</a>'s book, I managed to present for 75 minutes with no slides. All demo. It's fun! We played with the Application designer, the Logical Data Centre Designer and&nbsp;the System Designer in VSTS. We also implemented a Web Service and a VSTO application.

<p>If you're interested in starting a developer group at work, read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/davidlem/archive/2006/07/25/677643.aspx">Dave's post</a> and contact your local Developer Evangelist. If you're not in Australia and you don't know who your local Developer Evangelist is, drop me a note and I'll find out for you.</p></div>
