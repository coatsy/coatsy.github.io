<div id='content'>When the MSSCCI Provider for Team Foundation Server was announced, I was very excited. VFP (like the VS6 IDE, VS2002 and VS2003 as well as many other IDEs such as SQL Enterprise Manager) has the ability to utilise a MSSCCI compliant Source Control provider. The one most commonly used for VFP is Visual Source Safe, but I really wanted to hook into some of the great new features of TFS&rsquo;s enterprise Source Control capabilities.<p>I was a little disappointed to discover that the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=32202966-EF04-442F-8C5C-88BDF15F551C&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">preview version</a> released late last year had a problem that precluded its use with VFP (C0000005 error anyone?). Of course, I reported this back up to the product teams (VFP and TFS) and was happy to hear back today that the problem&rsquo;s been fixed and everything should be fine in the beta due to be released in the next week or so.</p></div>
