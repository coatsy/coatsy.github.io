<div id='content'><p>Back in the day, I wrote a bunch of articles for what was, then, pretty much the leading Visual FoxPro magazine. I used to have these published elsewhere on the web, but that site's pretty much dormant now and so I thought I'd pop them up here as well. </p>  <p>This one was first published in FoxTalk December 1998, so the content is not necessarily relevant to today's versions of OSs and App Dev environments. Remember, This was the days of VFP 5.0, Windows NT 4 and Win 95/98</p>  <p><font color="#ff0000">Update</font> – Thanks to <a href="http://mashupx.com/blog/">Ken Levy</a> for pointing out to me that you can do this exact thing with the My.Computer.FileSystem namespace in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C04BCF8C-0944-49F0-AC2B-563518CE1D70&amp;displaylang=en">Sedna</a> – as per below:</p>  <pre class="code">my = NEWOBJECT(&quot;my&quot;, &quot;my.vcx&quot;)
loDrive = My.Computer.FileSystem.GetDriveInfo('J:')
? loDrive.ShareName &amp;&amp; returns the UNC path</pre>

<hr /><cite>One commonly stored piece of information is the location of a file or folder. If that file or folder is on the network, however, different users may refer to the location through different drive mappings. In this article Andrew shows us how to decode the mapped location using the Windows API so that any user can view or retrieve the file or folder.</cite> 

<p>I learnt something this week that I guess I should have known. The Win32API is not consistent across operating systems. There are functions that work fine under Windows NT, but that fail miserably when called under Win95. I found one when working on the subject matter for this article.</p>

<p>Mapping network drives is a common way of simplifying network storage systems from a user's point of view. Unfortunately for the cause of universal access, however, different users map network shares to different driver letters. If your application allows users to store links to files, how can you tell whether E:\COMMON DOCUMENTS\BUDGET98.XLS and W:\BUDGET98.XLS refer to the same document? Even more importantly, how can a third user who has neither E: or W: mapped retrieve the document?</p>

<p>The answer is UNC. The Universal Naming Convention uses the format \\SERVER\SHARENAME\ to refer to the location of a file or folder. In the example above, the first user may have mapped drive E to \\SERVER_PDC\PUB, and the second may have mapped drive W to \\SERVER_PDC\COMMONDOC.</p>

<p>Any Visual FoxPro function that accepts a path as a parameter will handle UNC paths. However, returning a UNC path from the getfile() and getdir() functions is a completely different matter. These functions are central to allowing your users to specify the location of files and folders. The getfile() function will return a UNC path, but only if the user navigates to the file through the network neighborhood – something a user used to having a network drive mapped is unlikely to do. The getdir() function is even worse. There is no way of getting it to return a UNC path to a folder (except in one specific instance – see the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/controlpanel/blogs/posteditor.aspx?SelectedNavItem=Posts&amp;sectionid=3901&amp;postid=9445024#Sidebar" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/controlpanel/blogs/posteditor.aspx?SelectedNavItem=Posts&amp;sectionid=3901&amp;postid=9445024#Sidebar">sidebar</a> for details). Not only do the functions not return UNC paths, VFP does not provide any way to convert a mapped path to a UNC path.</p>

<h2>Win32API to the rescue!</h2>

<p>The windows 32 bit API provides a function that accepts a mapped path and returns the UNC path that corresponds to that mapped path. I searched through the API documentation and found a function called WnetGetUniversalName() in mpr.dll in the system directory. The function will accept the path to either a file, or to a folder with or without a trailing backslash.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this function is only available under Windows NT. I found this out the hard way, having developed and tested a routine using WnetGetUniversalName on my WinNT development box, I proudly installed it on a client's Win95 machine, only to have it not work;. Microsoft have a Knowledge Base article confirming that it doesn't work under Win95 (there's no mention in the article of Win98). So much for a single, consistent Win32API!</p>

<p>What the article does mention though, is a couple of work-arounds. The first involves about 30 lines of C code that calls another couple of functions in mpr.dll. The second mentions in passing that there's yet another function in mpr.dll called WnetGetConnection(). WnetGetConnection() is not quite as versatile as WnetGetUniversalName(). It only accepts a drive letter and a colon (e.g. H:), rather than a full path. With a little string manipulation, however, it's pretty easy to split up a mapped path, pass the function what it wants and then re-assemble a complete UNC path from the pieces.</p>

<p>To take the drudgery out of calling the Windows API, I wrote a wrapper function called GetUNCPath() that I include in any project in which I call either getdir() or getfile(). You could, of course, write wrappers for getfile() and getdir() which called GetUNCPath().</p>

<p>For example, if the pub share on the server_pdc server were mapped as drive s:</p>

<pre class="code">? GetUNCPath('s:\documents') 
\\server_pdc\pub\documents 
? GetUNCPath('c:\temp') 
c:\temp 
? GetUNCPath('s:\documents\myfile.doc') 
\\server_pdc\pub\documents\myfile.doc </pre>

<p>The wrapper function itself is pretty straightforward. The complete function is shown in listing 1 and is available in the download file (2k). It accepts the mapped drive path as a compulsory parameter and optionally a length for the UNC version of the path. This second parameter is most often passed by the function itself in a recursive call if the default buffer size guess is not large enough (more on this later).</p>

<p>Constants from the corresponding API header files are reproduced in the function rather than in a stand-alone header to make it more portable and a couple of local constants are also #DEFINEd for clarity later in the code.</p>

<p>The mapped drive parameter is checked and if it is not a character expression, or if it's .NULL., then the function simply returns whatever was passed to it. If the tests are passed, then the API function is DECLAREd. Note the use of the WIN32API rather than the specific mpr.dll.</p>

<p>Splitting up the mapped path parameter into its component pieces is simply a matter of taking the first two characters and calling them the mapped drive, and taking the rest of the expression and calling them the path. There's no problem if that's not a valid assumption because the API function will return an error value and we'll take the appropriate action.</p>

<p>Next I call the API function and check the return value. The two important values I'm looking for are NO_ERROR (my personal favorite &lt;g&gt;) and ERROR_MORE_DATA. The NO_ERROR code means just that: the drive mapping was decoded successfully, and the result is in the lcBuffer variable.</p>

<p>The value placed in lcBuffer is a null-terminated string. This means that the string is terminated by a chr(0) that needs to be stripped before we use it in VFP. I just append the path part of the original mapped path parameter to the translated drive returned by the PAI call and <i>viola</i>, a UNC version of the mapped path.</p>

<p>The ERROR_MORE_DATA return value tells me that I didn't allocate enough space in the return buffer and I need to call the function again. Fortunately, once I get this error, I no longer need to guess how long to make the buffer. In addition to returning the error, the API function sets lnBufferSize to the value required so I can call GetUNCPath() recursively with the original mapped drive path and lnBufferSize.</p>

<p>Each of the other error states indicates that the mapping could not be decoded for some reason or other. I've decided to treat them all the same way: simply return the mapped path passed to the function.</p>

<p>While Visual FoxPro is a wonderful development environment it does have some limitations. Fortunately it provides enough access to the Windows API to be able to work around most of them.</p>

<h3><a title="Sidebar" name="Sidebar"></a>Sidebar - Returning a UNC Path from getdir()</h3>

<p>If you pass getdir() an initial folder in UNC format, then that folder will be the initially selected folder but it will not appear in the list of drives in the dialog (see <b>Figure 1</b>). If that folder or one of its sub folders is selected then the string returned will be in UNC. Be careful though. If you navigate to a mapped or local drive from the drives drop-down box, there's no way to get back to the UNC drive.</p>
