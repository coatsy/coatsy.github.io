<div id='content'><p>We had our second meeting of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2006/11/20/teaching-quot-programming-quot-to-primary-school-kids.aspx">School Programming Club</a> last Monday. As the boys want to write an online game, I decided that we should start with some basics about the most common online delivery mechanism, HTML.</p> <p>We talked about the structure of HTML and about tags. I also set them a task for next Monday:</p> <blockquote> <p>This week we talked about HTML – Hypertext Markup Language.  <p>In particular we discussed the fact that HTML uses tags to "mark up" the parts of a page, that is, give the items on the page context and properties.  <p>Tags are instructions enclosed in less than and greater than signs, and they should either appear in pairs with an opening and a closing tag like this: <pre>&lt;h1&gt;This text is a level-1 heading&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
<p>Or be self-closing, like this: <pre>&lt;img src="images/image1.jpg" /&gt;</pre>
<p>The tags are interpreted by a web browser like Internet Explorer and the result of their content displayed. 
<p>An HTML page has two parts, the header of the page, which contains information about the page, and the page body, which is what’s displayed on the screen. A sample HTML page might look like this: <pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;This is a valid HTML page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is a level 1 heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some text in a paragraph. In a web browser, it will be rendered in the default 
font at the default size. Notice that even though we haven't specified a different font 
for the heading above, it's automatically been assigned different attributes because it's 
been tagged as a heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p>Viewing this in Internet Explorer looks like this: 
<p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="362" src="http://candrew.members.winisp.net/blogimages/TeachingprogrammingtoprimaryschoolkidsPa_8ADE/clip_image0028.jpg" width="435" border="0"> 
<p>There’s lots more information about HTML all over the web

<p>Here’s what I asked you to do for next week: 
<p>Use the second or third link above to create an HTML page about you. Use tags and include: 
<ul>
<li>Headings 
<li>Images 
<li>Links to other pages 
<li>Some other HTML tags 
<li>For extra credit - research styles (CSS)</li></ul>
<p><b><font color="red">E-mail me your pages before our meeting on Monday and we can have a look at them.</font></b></p></blockquote>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing how self-educating these guys are. One of the real requirements of a good programmer is the thirst for knowledge and the ability to do some research to find it (that and laziness)</p></div>
