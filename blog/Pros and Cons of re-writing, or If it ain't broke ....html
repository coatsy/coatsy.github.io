<div id='content'><a href="http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/">Rick Strahl</a>, formerly a <a title="" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vfoxpro" target="_blank">VFP</a> MVP and now a .NET MVP (in C# I think, but with Rick it would just have been a matter of choosing a category) has a <a href="http://west-wind.com/weblog/posts/752.aspx">great post</a> on why he's not re-writing one of his flagship applications (currently written in VFP) in .NET. Well worth a read. While you're there, have a look at some of the very neat things Rick is doing with both VFP and .NET.<p>BTW, Rick will be out here in Australia at the end of November to speak at <a title="" href="http://www.ozfox.com.au/" target="_blank">OzFox</a>, along with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/klevy/">Ken Levy</a> and a bevy of great speakers.</p></div>
