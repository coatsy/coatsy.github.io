One of the things I do a lot of is presentations. Not just PowerPoints though, I also show the computer doing things, often with me making it do those things, so I need a mouse as well (right-click-dragging with the touch pad is not a great demo technique). 

I used to travel with a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/Presenter/productdetails.aspx?pid=092">Presenter 3000</a> and a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=048">Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000</a>

Both great, but each took up a USB port and each requires batteries.

I've recently switched to a great hybrid device - the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=085">Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000</a>&nbsp;- hold it one way and it's a conventional high-precision mouse. Press the button and turn it over and it's a wireless presenter.

<p>It's been rock solid and is a pleasure to use. I like to get away from the computer when I'm telling a story or talking to slides, and I haven't yet been in a room big enough for it to lose connectivity, even when I wander right down the back.

I do miss a couple of things from my combo pack above though. The dongle doesn't slot into the mouse anywhere like the Laser Mouse 6000 does, and there's no timer like there is on the Presenter 3000.

<p>All-in-all I give it&nbsp;9.5/10.</p></div>
