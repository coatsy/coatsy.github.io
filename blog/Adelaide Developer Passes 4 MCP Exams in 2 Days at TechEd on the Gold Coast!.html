<div id='content'>I was chatting with <a href="http://robfarley.blogspot.com/">Rob Farley</a> at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/events/teched2005/default.aspx">TechEd</a> and he casually mentioned that he&rsquo;d signed up for a couple of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2005/08/17/452533.aspx">Free MCP exams</a> we had on offer. He went on to say that he&rsquo;d finished the first one in such quick time on day 1 (and passed), that he asked the proctor whether he could sit the second in the same time slot. He did, and passed it too. He changed his booking for the next day to another 2 exams (in the one timeslot) and passed both those too!

Great work Rob! There&rsquo;s a special edition <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/">Microsoft eLearning</a> cap on its way. I&rsquo;ve got another cap waiting for the next best TechEd certification story I get (entries close 18 Sep).
