<div id='content'>Via <a href="http://doughennig.blogspot.com/2007/08/lisa-blogs.html">Doug</a>. I've been reading Lisa's <a href="http://spacefold.com/lisa/oldsite/lisa_fox.aspx">stuff</a> since before she retired the whip (I've still got the notes from the conference I saw her speak at in, I think, 1993)&nbsp;and then her voluminous public output slowed to a trickle. Every once in a while another gem would appear and was as good as before but left one hanging for more. Finally I discover <a href="http://spacefold.com/lisa/">she's blogging</a> (and has been for nearly a month).<p><a href="http://spacefold.com/lisa/syndication.axd">SUBSCRIBED</a>!</p></div>
