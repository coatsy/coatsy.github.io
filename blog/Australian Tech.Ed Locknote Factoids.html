<div id='content'><p>This year at <a href="http://australia.msteched.com/" target="_blank">TechEd Australia</a> (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23auteched" target="_blank">#auteched</a>) the locknote was delivered by Miha Kralj, Director in the office of the CTO. The session was entitled &quot;How IT is changing us and our future&quot; and was delivered using a very cool style called <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/" target="_blank">PechaKucha</a> – 20 slides, each on the screen for 20 seconds. Miha actually delivered 5 x 20 slides, an introduction and then a section based loosely on each of the four TechEd themes – Learn, Connect, Explore and Evolve.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="Miha Kralj, Director in the office of the CTO" align="right" src="media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/39/01/metablogapi/7043.4Y6H7253_3.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-39-01-metablogapi/7043.4Y6H7253_5F00_3.jpg" width="320" height="480" />The style features information overload, with each slide having at least two, and sometimes as many as four separate but complementary pieces of information appearing during the 20 seconds. Common things in Miha's presentation were a scrolling factoid across the bottom of the slide and a &quot;Book worth reading&quot; recommendation that appeared at about the 10 second mark.</p>  <p>Due to popular demand and with Miha's permission, I've compiled the factoids and book recommendations from his deck. The recording of the session itself will be available from <a href="http://www.msteched.com/" target="_blank">TechEd Online</a> some time in the very near future. </p>  <h1>Books worth reading</h1>  <p>Guy Kawasaki: <i>Reality Check</i></p>  <p>Byron Acohido, Jon Swartz: <i>Zero Day Threat</i></p>  <p>Elting E.
