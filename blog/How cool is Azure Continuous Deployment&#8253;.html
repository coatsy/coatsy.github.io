<div id='content'><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn Angular this week (see <a href="http://github.com/coatsy/weather">http://github.com/coatsy/weather</a>)<p>I started with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vscode/archive/2015/05/22/getting-started-with-angular-and-visual-studio-code.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vscode/archive/2015/05/22/getting-started-with-angular-and-visual-studio-code.aspx</a> (which, in turn, uses <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial">https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial</a>)</p><p>And then I tried writing some of my own stuff &ndash; ending up with a page that allows you to look up the current weather in any of 20,000 cities around the world.</p><p>Great intro to a bunch of the tools and tech I haven&rsquo;t used much and I&rsquo;m really trying hard not to throw up my hands and go back to the nice, safe, easy, understandable smart client way of doing things (and don&rsquo;t get me started on debugging JavaScript). npm is pretty cool, I&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface with bower, bootstrap is pretty neat and angular itself is kind of fun to work with in a weird, masochistic kind of way.</p><p>Along the way though, I remembered that <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/">Azure has continuous deployment</a> from a number of sources, including github (and VSO and a couple of others), so now every time I push to the repo, it gets deployed automatically to <a href="http://coatsysandbox.azurewebsites.net/app">http://coatsysandbox.azurewebsites.net/app</a>.</p><p>Very cool.</p><p>BTW, (Did you spot the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang">interrobang</a>?)</p></p>
