<div id='content'>One of the most effective ways to get a message, any message, across is to use stories. For some reason the human brain appears to be wired to be good at remembering and regurgitating stories. I like to begin presentations with a story that&rsquo;s somehow relevant and am always on the lookout for a good story to add to my repertoire.

The best stories seem to be those told from a personal perspective - either something that happened to you or something you witnessed. Good stories also stir emotions, both in the storyteller and the listener.

<a href="http://www.themoth.org/"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" border="0" alt="The Moth" align="left" src="http://www.themoth.org/images/logo.gif"></a>This week I heard two stories that did just that. I&rsquo;ve been a listener to the Moth Podcast for some time now, and have always enjoyed the mix of professional storytelling with deeply personal and evocative content. Two of the stories I heard this week though moved me as much or more than any other I&rsquo;ve heard.

The first, told by a comedian, wasn&rsquo;t funny. The second, told by someone who plays the blues, was uplifting. Both made either made me laugh or cry - literally out loud.

Listen to

and then tell me whether you experienced the same thing.
