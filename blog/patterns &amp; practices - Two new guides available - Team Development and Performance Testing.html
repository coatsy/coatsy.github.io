<div id='content'>As one of the pillars of Visual Studio Team System, I always talk about the guidance, both built into the system as process guidance and available as best practice from the patterns &amp; practices team. There are two new guides available for download (or to purchase in hard copy).

<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/tfsguide"><b>patterns &amp; practices Team Development with Visual Studio Team Foundation Server</b></a>     <br>This guide shows you how to make the most of Team Foundation Server. It starts with the end in mind, but shows you how to incrementally adopt TFS for your organization. It's a collaborative effort between patterns &amp; practices, Team System team members, and industry experts.

<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/perftestingguide"><b>patterns &amp; practices Performance Testing Guidance for Web Applications</b></a>     <br>This guide shows you an end-to-end approach for implementing performance testing. Whether you are new to performance testing, or looking for ways to improve your current performance testing approach, you will find insights that you can tailor for your specific scenarios.
