<div id='content'>One of the common questions I get asked when I do sessions on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/aa905533.aspx" target="_blank">VSTO</a>/<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/aa905528.aspx" target="_blank">OBA</a> development is "how can I target Office 2003 <em>and</em> Office 2007?" (I also get asked about previous versions of Office, but I have a less helpful response there). Mary Lee's done a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vsto/archive/2008/03/20/developing-an-add-in-for-multiple-versions-of-office.aspx" target="_blank">great post</a> about this very topic as has Andrew Whitechapel (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andreww/archive/2007/06/15/can-you-build-one-add-in-for-multiple-versions-of-office.aspx">Can you build one add-in for multiple versions of Office?</a>). There's also an MSDN page (<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb772080.aspx">Creating Solutions for Multiple Versions of Microsoft Office</a>).<p>Of course, there are a few questions you need to ask yourself when you're considering going down this path. Especially with Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2008/03/12/the-story-of-the-ribbon.aspx" target="_blank">the UI is radically different</a>. If you're really <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2007/09/25/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants.aspx" target="_blank">taking advantage of the platform</a>, you need to consider whether it's feasible to package the common logic in a library and deploy just a UI wrapper that is suited to the target app. </p></div>
